# NgxModelDrivenForm

## Build

Run `npm run build` in this directory to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
>⚠️ Don't use `ng build ngx-model-driven-form`! It does not include the build for the schematics-generator files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-model-driven-form` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-model-driven-form`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-model-driven-form` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.
